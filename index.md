## About me
Hello and welcome! ðŸ˜Š 

Iâ€™m BÃ¡rbara Lobato Delgado, a data scientist with a strong passion for transforming data into meaningful insights. With a background in bioinformatics, statistical analysis and machine learning, Iâ€™ve spent the past five years working on biomedical data, from clinical studies to genomics and AI-driven predictive modeling.

My work has taken me from analyzing cancer patient cohorts to developing machine learning models that improve prognosis and risk prediction. I love tackling complex problems â€” whether itâ€™s making sense of genetic data, optimizing workflows, or leveraging AI to uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

What excites me most about data science is its ability to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications. I thrive in interdisciplinary environments where I can collaborate with clinicians, researchers, and engineers to turn raw data into actionable insights. For me, data science isnâ€™t just about algorithms â€” itâ€™s about solving meaningful problems and driving impact.
